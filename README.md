# Python
This will be used to store projects and exercises as I work my way through the Python Mastery course by CodeWithMosh.
I am beginning with the free video on YouTube but will likely just end up buying the course tomorrow and working through it that way.

Hopefully this will be a neat journal to look back on and see how my code has improved over time!
